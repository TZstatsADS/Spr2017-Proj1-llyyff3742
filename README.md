### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2017

+ Projec title: Sentiment Analysis
+ This project is conducted by Yifei Lin

+ Project summary: In this project, I perform sentiment analysis on presidential speeches in order to find out how emotions vary based on different political parties, different terms and whether they won or not. My results show that Emotions varied dramatically through different parties due to their distinct believes and some historical reasons. Also, for presidents who had two terms, their second-term speeches appeared to be more sophisiticated than first-term speeches in that they were more experienced. Furthermore, loss speeches were more extreme than win speeches which, intuitively, made them lose the nomination battle.
